# Udagram Users Backend REST API

A Node Express backend Users REST API refactored from monolith (second project of Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree) to microservices using docker containers.

This REST API communicates with the Ionic frontend through a reverse proxy, the Feed REST API and an AWS RDS database.

For the purpose of Postman testing, the expiration time of the user frontend token has been increased.

## Installation instructions

The installation instructions are in the project root (/udagram-dtm-microservices) README.
