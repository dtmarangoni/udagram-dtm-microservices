# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This is an image filtering microservice refactored from monolith (second project of Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree) to microservices using docker containers.

This service is intended to process user posted photos.

It communicates with the backend Feed REST API server. The server-server authentication and authorization is done by a client id and access token.

For the purpose of Postman testing, the expiration time of the access token has been increased.

## Installation instructions

The installation instructions are in the project root (/udagram-dtm-microservices) README.
